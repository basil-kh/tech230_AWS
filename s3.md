# Using S3 in python:
```python
pip install boto3
```
Boto3 is a Python library provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows developers to interact with AWS services using Python code. It provides an easy-to-use API for creating, configuring, and managing AWS resources programmatically. With Boto3, developers can write Python applications that utilize various AWS services such as EC2, S3, DynamoDB, and more, making it simpler to automate tasks and build applications that integrate with AWS.

- Accessing S3
```python
import boto3

# Connect to S3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

# List Buckets
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```python
- create bucket
```python
import boto3

# Connect to S3
s3 = boto3.client("s3")

# Create S3 Bucket
bucket_name = s3.create_bucket(Bucket = "tech230-basil-boto", CreateBucketConfiguration={"LocationConstraint": "eu-west-1"})

# Print Name
print(bucket_name)
```

```python
import boto3

# Connect to S3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

# Opens the file we want to send, and stores it in a variable
data = open("sampletext.txt", "rb")

# Specify the bucket were sending to:
# ".put_object" names the file and sends the contents
s3.Bucket("tech230-basil-boto").put_object(Key = "sampletext.txt", Body = data)

# Can view on AWS to verify
